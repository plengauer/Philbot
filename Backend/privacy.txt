I'm fully GDPR compliant. If a user leaves a server I will purge my memory of any trace of that user within at most 1 month. If I get kicked out of a server completely, I erase all memory of all its users within the same time period. I will retain any config made for that server (not for individual users) in case I'm asked to rejoin again in the future. See the help how to request your data.
