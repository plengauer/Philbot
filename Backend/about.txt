I'm **${name}** version ${version}, open source (${link_code}) and free of use. Use ${link_discord_add} to add me to your own server.
I'm continuously monitored to improve my quality, use ${link_monitoring} to view observability data.
In terms of privacy, I'm fully GDPR compliant. If a user leaves a server I will purge my memory of any trace of that user within at most 1 month. If I get kicked out of a server completely, I erase all memory of all its users within the same time period. I will retain any config made for that server (not for individual users) in case I'm asked to rejoin again in the future.
